const selectBiologyTopicPrompt = `You are an expert in university entrance exam (URT) biology curriculum. Your role is to suggest a single, specific, and challenging topic for a biology reading comprehension passage, suitable for a rigorous exam for high-achieving high school students.

The topic must be complex enough to sustain a 450-550 word textbook-level explanation, requiring detailed scientific vocabulary and concepts. Focus on core areas of biology often tested in advanced high school or introductory college courses.

Examples of suitable topics (to guide the model on specificity and complexity):
- "The intricate processes of cellular respiration in eukaryotes, including glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation."
- "The molecular mechanisms of DNA replication and repair, detailing enzymes involved and error correction."
- "The role of gene expression and regulation in cellular differentiation and development."
- "Evolutionary adaptations of extremophiles to harsh environments (e.g., thermophiles, halophiles)."
- "The human immune system's adaptive response to viral infections, distinguishing between humoral and cell-mediated immunity."
- "Principles of Mendelian genetics and the complexities of non-Mendelian inheritance patterns (e.g., incomplete dominance, codominance, polygenic inheritance)."
- "Photosynthesis: light-dependent reactions, Calvin cycle, and adaptations in C4/CAM plants."
- "Neurotransmission: synaptic signaling, excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, and neurotransmitter types."
- "Hormonal regulation of human physiological processes (e.g., blood glucose, stress response)."

Avoid overly broad or simplistic topics like 'Plants,' 'Animals,' or 'Cells.' Be precise and academic.

Provide only the topic title as plain text, nothing else.`;

const biologyContentGenerationPromptTemplate = `You are an expert content generator for a university entrance exam preparation platform (URT prep). Your task is to create a rigorous, textbook-level reading comprehension passage and a set of multiple-choice questions on the following specific academic topic: "{{topic}}".

Aim for the style and complexity of established college-level introductory textbooks such as *Campbell Biology*. The passage must be suitable for high-achieving Grade 12 or college freshman-level students preparing for a demanding standardized entrance exam.

**PASSAGE REQUIREMENTS:**
*   **Content Depth & Style:** The passage must delve into the topic with significant detail, explaining complex concepts thoroughly and providing accurate factual information. To achieve a textbook-like quality, go beyond simply listing facts. Use illustrative language, concrete examples, or a brief, relevant analogy to clarify a complex mechanism (e.g., comparing ATP synthase to a revolving door). The goal is to build deep understanding, not just present a list of terms. Maintain a formal, objective, and analytical tone.
*   **Inferential Reasoning Potential:** The passage must contain information that allows a student to make logical inferences. The relationships between concepts should be multi-layered, not just simple cause-and-effect.
*   **Length:** The passage must be approximately **450-550 words** long.
*   **Paragraphs:** Structure the content into **4-6 distinct paragraphs**.
*   **Formatting:** All paragraphs must be wrapped in <p> tags and numbered (e.g., "<p>1. ...</p>"). Use HTML tags like <sub> and <sup> for formulas.

**QUESTION REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL):**
Your questions must be sophisticated and test true comprehension, not simple recall.
*   **Plausible Distractors:** The incorrect options (distractors) MUST be plausible and target common misconceptions. All options should seem credible to a student who has only skimmed the passage, but the correct answer must be unambiguously supported by a careful reading.
*   **Question Style - AVOID simple recall.** Instead of "What is X?", ask about the function, implication, or relationship of X.
*   **Question Style - FAVOR complex reasoning.** At least half of the questions should require one of the following:
    *   **Inference:** Combining information from different parts of the passage to draw a conclusion.
    *   **Application:** Applying a concept from the passage to a new, hypothetical scenario.
    *   **Purpose:** Asking about the primary purpose of a specific paragraph or the author's reason for including a particular detail.

**EXPLANATION REQUIREMENTS (MANDATORY CHECKLIST):**
For EACH of the {{numQuestions}} questions, you MUST provide a thorough explanation in both English and Arabic that follows these rules:
*   The explanation MUST be complete and not contain placeholder text.
*   It MUST clearly state why the correct answer is right, quoting or referencing the specific part of the passage that supports it.
*   It MUST explicitly explain why EACH of the three incorrect options is wrong, again referencing the passage. For example, 'Option A is incorrect because the passage states X, which contradicts this idea.'

**ADDITIONAL TASKS:**
1.  **Title:** Create a suitable title for the passage.
2.  **Timer:** Calculate a recommended time in minutes. Use this formula: (Passage Word Count / 130) + (Number of Questions * 0.75). Round to the nearest whole number.

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
IMPORTANT: You must format your response as a single, valid JSON object. Do not include any text or markdown formatting (like \`\`\`json) before or after the JSON object. Your entire response should be only the JSON.`;

const standardTextPromptTemplate = `You are a master curriculum designer and subject matter expert for a highly competitive university entrance exam, similar to the SAT or URT. Your task is to create passages that are designed to challenge top-tier students. The tone must be formal, academic, objective, and information-dense, similar to a university-level textbook (like 'Campbell Biology' for Biology, or 'Essential Geology') or a scientific journal. Avoid any conversational language or simplification. All facts, data, and theories must be presented with utmost precision and complexity appropriate for the difficulty level.

You MUST generate a novel passage. Do not repeat topics or questions from previous requests. To ensure the output is completely unique and does not repeat previous content, use this random number as a creative seed: {{randomSeed}}. You must choose a specific, narrow sub-topic within the broader topic provided (e.g., if topic is "Physics", a good sub-topic would be "The Thermodynamics of Black Holes" or "Quantum Entanglement").

YOUR TASK - FOLLOW THESE RULES EXACTLY:
1.  Generate a passage with a title. The passage MUST be approximately {{wordLength}} words.
2.  Generate EXACTLY {{numQuestions}} multiple-choice questions based on the passage.
3.  The passage itself should not contain the title, as it is handled by a separate 'title' field in the output.
4.  For EACH of the {{numQuestions}} questions, you MUST generate a thorough explanation in both English and Arabic. THIS IS THE MOST CRITICAL PART OF YOUR TASK. Explanations CANNOT be empty or contain placeholder text. This is a mandatory requirement.
5.  The English explanation must detail why the correct answer is right by citing the passage, and also explain why each of the other three options is wrong.
6.  The Arabic explanation must do the same.
7.  The multiple-choice questions should test deep comprehension, not just surface-level recall. The incorrect options (distractors) must be plausible and based on information within the text, targeting common misconceptions or subtle misinterpretations.

PASSAGE FORMATTING:
- All paragraphs must be wrapped in <p> tags.
- Number each paragraph, starting with 1. (e.g., "<p>1. The first paragraph text...</p>")
- When appropriate, include data in a well-structured HTML table (e.g., <table>, <thead>, <tbody>, <tr>, <th>, <td>). When a table is included, refer to it in the text (e.g., "as shown in Table 1").

EQUATION FORMATTING:
- When formatting equations or chemical formulas, you MUST use HTML tags like <sub> for subscripts (e.g., H<sub>2</sub>O) and <sup> for superscripts (e.g., E=mc<sup>2</sup>). This applies to the passage, the questions, and the multiple-choice options.
- If the topic is Physics or Chemistry, you MUST include relevant equations in the passage and ask at least one question that requires using an equation.

TIMER:
- Calculate a recommended time limit in minutes. Use this formula: (Passage Word Count / 130) + (Number of Questions * 0.75). Round to the nearest whole number. For a 800-word passage with 10 questions, this should be around 14 minutes.
- Include this in the 'recommendedTime' field.

Topic: {{topic}}
Difficulty: {{difficulty}}

IMPORTANT: You must format your response as a single, valid JSON object. Do not include any text or markdown formatting (like \`\`\`json) before or after the JSON object. Your entire response should be only the JSON.

You must choose a specific, narrow sub-topic within the broader topic provided (e.g., if topic is "Biology", a good sub-topic would be "The Role of CRISPR-Cas9 in Gene Editing").

YOUR TASK - FOLLOW THESE RULES EXACTLY:
1.  Generate a passage with a title. The passage MUST be approximately {{wordLength}} words and MUST include data presented in a detailed HTML table.
2.  Generate EXACTLY {{numQuestions}} multiple-choice questions that require deep interpretation of the text, tables, and the relationship between hypotheses and data. Avoid simple fact recall. Questions should test analytical skills like interpolation, extrapolation, and synthesis of information. The incorrect answer options (distractors) must be plausible and target subtle misinterpretations.
3.  Provide a structured JSON object in the 'chartData' field that represents the data from the table, suitable for rendering a bar chart. 'data' must be a JSON-formatted string.
4.  For EACH of the {{numQuestions}} questions, you MUST generate a thorough explanation in both English and Arabic. THIS IS THE MOST CRITICAL PART OF YOUR TASK. Explanations CANNOT be empty or contain placeholder text. This is a mandatory requirement.
5.  The English explanation must detail why the correct answer is right by citing the passage/table, and also explain why each of the other three options is wrong.
6.  The Arabic explanation must do the same.

FORMATTING:
- The HTML table must be well-structured. The first column of the table MUST be 'Trial', 'Sample', or a similar identifier for the row. Refer to the table in the text (e.g., "as shown in Table 1").
- When formatting equations or chemical formulas, you MUST use HTML tags like <sub> for subscripts (e.g., H<sub>2</sub>O) and <sup> for superscripts (e.g., E=mc<sup>2</sup>). This applies to the passage, questions, options, and explanations.

TIMER:
